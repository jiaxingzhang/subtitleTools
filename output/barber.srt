1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:25,100
I travel me to the the compensation.


2
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,900
The writer of this him was a sister little known to the world or Christianity,


3
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,900
but who at the beginning of the 20th century occupied a Paramount place in the Lord's move in China?


4
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,900
It was through her that Watchman Nee


5
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,300
a seer of the divine revelation in the present age was introduced to the way of life.


6
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,000
In the next 30 minutes,


7
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,800
we want to look at the life and


8
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,200
time of this marvelous yet hidden vessel of God


9
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,900
whose hymns and life have touched thousands of lives and have become an encouragement to Generations afterwards


10
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Margaret. Emma Barber was born in 1866 in peasant Hall in County Suffolk in the south of England


11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,200
the daughter of Louis and


12
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,000
The barber


13
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,800
according to the records of the family records Center her father was a wheel right one who repairs wheels


14
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,800
and as such she would have been raised in a rather humble environment


15
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,100
in 1890 when she was 24


16
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:19,000
a call was made in Faraway China by Hudson Taylor at the conference of protestant missionaries of China.


17
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
We do now appeal to you


18
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,200
the Protestant churches of Christian lands the center China in response to these calls


19
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,100
1,000 men within five years from this time.


20
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,100
We make this appeal in behalf of 300 Millions upon evangelized Heathen.


21
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,100
We make it with all the earnestness of our whole Hearts as men overwhelm


22
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,800
with a magnitude and


23
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,900
responsibilities of the work before.


24
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,100
With in exactly five years of such a call in 1895


25
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,700
Emmy Barber set sail for China under the direction and


26
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,600
with the support


27
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,200
of the church missionary Society of London


28
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,700
by February of the following year.


29
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,700
She arrived in Hong Kong


30
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,700
and in March in fuchao.


31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,400
Dear, mr. Barring gold.


32
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,600
It was lovely to rest on our fathers words.


33
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,300
He shall cover thee


34
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,500
as we stepped for the first time upon this soil


35
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,100
and realize perhaps as never before the honor.


36
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,300
God had put upon us.


37
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,900
It was one of the happiest days of my life when I really landed in China


38
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,900
Margaret ibaba,


39
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,300
March 6 1896


40
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,000
soon after arriving.


41
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,900
She was assigned to the Village of konkow together with two other lady missionaries


42
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,500
and she immediately immersed herself in the needs around her.


43
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,100
Because of the poor condition of her dwelling she was asked to move back to the city


44
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,900
Tim is devouring gold.


45
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm extremely sorry to hear from mr.


46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,800
Lloyd that there is a probability


47
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,700
that we may get orders from England to leave our station and


48
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,600
go to fuchao.


49
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,900
I am writing to ask you to allow us to remain here.


50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,200
When dr.


51
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Taylor was here.


52
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Our house was being sealed


53
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,700
since this work has been done.


54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,500
The difference has been wonderful


55
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,100
before the house was sealed the strong winds which are soaked.


56
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,800
Old and searching on the Seacoast comes sweeping up through the cracks in the board's


57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
we could never get warm anywhere


58
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,500
the malaria if there is any will also now be prevented from rising


59
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,200
the work here is glorious more and more and there is plenty for us all three to do


60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,100
with kind regard.


61
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,900
I Am Yours Faithfully Margaret a barber March 16th 1898


62
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,800
Full Chow at the turn of the century was a bustling City


63
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,600
it lies on both sides of the men River at the Estuary


64
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,900
to the north of the river was the old city proper


65
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,000
to the South a community of more recent development mainly spurred by the settlement of foreigners and Christian missions.


66
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,300
In the middle of the river and Island and spanning the river Was An Old Bridge the Thousand-Year Bridge


67
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,900
built of huge chunks of ancient rocks


68
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,600
here Miss Barbara was assigned to teach at the Town Sue girls high school for seven years.


69
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,400
Woo Me O Lord from Easy paths whose flowers I gather as I go.


70
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,000
That I a deeper fellowship with thee May daily hourly. No.


71
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,800
Speak to me Lord,


72
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,500
but as I climb the steeper Heights,


73
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,900
my soul may hear thy voice which never fails to nerve my heart


74
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,200
and drive away my fear


75
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,400
and if dear Lord the flesh would Fain forsake the heights forgo the prize.


76
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,700
Fasten On Me by Look of Love and


77
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,200
make me meet by searching eyes.


78
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:54,400
Thus woo me speak to me and be the light to lead me on and on


79
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,500
until those glorious Heights are gained where thou o Christ Our Holy One.


80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,500
Because of the rich Life of Christ overflowing in her excellent living


81
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,500
many students were attracted and


82
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,400
desired Miss Barbara's instruction.


83
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,600
This made the principal jealous of her the principal accused her of ten illegal matters


84
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
while she was being carefully examined.


85
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,900
She had a feeling before the Lord


86
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,700
if the thumb argues with the little finger it only hurts the head


87
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,300
so I should just leave this school.


88
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,100
She was completely obedient to Christ and


89
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,600
quietly left the school


90
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,900
even so a list of her crimes was sent to the parent Committee of the British Mission


91
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
during that time.


92
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,300
She was learning to remain silent under the shadow of the Cross


93
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,300
preferring rather to suffer misunderstanding than defend herself.


94
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,600
She said nothing in answer to the false charges.


95
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,300
She returned to England and


96
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,900
continued her silence offering no vindication.


97
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,100
One of her fellow missionaries,


98
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,100
however, eventually related the truth of the situation to the director responsible for the mission


99
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,800
realizing that she had placed herself under the authority of the Cross.


100
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,400
He finally told her


101
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:45,600
As your Authority I charge you to tell me the facts of what happened in China.


102
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,900
Don't hide anything.


103
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,900
Submitting herself to God's delegated authority.


104
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,800
She finally told him the truth of what had happened


105
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,500
in her case was cleared.


106
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Around this time.


107
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,200
She met brother DM Panton the editor of the Christian magazine called the dawn.


108
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,300
She received much help and


109
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,400
light from Panton.


110
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,500
He was clear about the matter of division.


111
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,300
He also knew the Prophecies of the Bible and


112
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
the truths concerning overcoming


113
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,500
he influenced her to live as a person waiting for the Lord's return.


114
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,600
During the two years that


115
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,100
she remained in England.


116
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,800
She exercised faith and


117
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,800
prayed that the Lord would open the way for her to go back to work in China.


118
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,900
Finally in 1909


119
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,200
with Fellowship from DM Panton and


120
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,800
the Surrey Chapel of Norwich where he ministered she returned to China


121
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,600
this time.


122
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,300
There was no big mission to support her she would go and


123
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,000
she would live by faith.


124
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,900
Her niece a Miss Ballard who was 20 years her Junior accompanied her to China


125
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,700
Miss Ballard had her own small savings,


126
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,200
but Emmy Barber had only the Lord of Psalm 23 as her Supply


127
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,600
while the ship crossed the Min river in China.


128
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,100
She quietly look to the Lord independent for her needs and her future.


129
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,200
About an hour's boat ride from fuchao farther down the mid-river lay the little Port of pagoda Anchorage


130
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,000
where the water is deeper and


131
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,900
larger ocean vessels take anchor


132
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,600
The Landmark low Sheen Pagoda.


133
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,100
Is there


134
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,300
across the bay from this Harbor was a little village known as by otacon


135
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,600
here


136
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,600
Emmy Barber chose to make her new home


137
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,400
from here.


138
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,900
She could catch a lovely view of the Moon River


139
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,500
and the Pagoda Anchorage across the bay.


140
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,500
This is the spot where me Barbara's house was situated in this clearing once stood a row of ten.


141
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,400
Wooden houses.


142
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,400
The landlord was a sister sister Shaw,


143
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
who was the principal of an orphanage?


144
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,700
This one is for Emmy Barber her Promised Land.


145
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,200
It was here that


146
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,800
she pitched a tent and


147
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,700
built an altar for the next 20 years


148
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,800
one year the landlord decided that


149
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
she needed the houses for the orphanage.


150
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,800
She asked Miss Barbara to move


151
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
and she sent Workman to make repairs on the houses.


152
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,300
However, Miss Barber continue to trust God that


153
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,700
he would not go against what he had promised


154
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
with confidence. She prayed.


155
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,400
Oh Father I beg you to make your promise firm


156
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,900
in the end the landlord sent someone to tell her that


157
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,600
the repaired houses were hers to live in


158
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,500
she resided there until her departure be with the Lord in 1930.


159
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,300
In the church assembly hall and biotin.


160
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,300
We met a man whose father served as Miss Barbara's cook during her stay in the village.


161
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,900
Sister Barbara came here to preach the gospel in 1911.


162
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,700
She traveled to the neighboring villages to see if anyone would believe in the Lord.


163
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,700
No one then new name of Jesus and


164
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,300
she began to preach the gospel


165
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,200
my father and my grandmother both moved here and later.


166
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
He served as her cook


167
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,000
at that time.


168
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,600
No one was a Believer and


169
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,100
she began to preach the gospel in the nearby Villages.


170
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,300
She would come to her home in preach while you would be cooking and burning firewood


171
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,300
and she would sit.


172
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,700
Down and helping the work while speaking God's word to you slowly bit by bit


173
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,500
in such a hidden way Miss Barbara began her Ministry,


174
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,500
even though outwardly there was little result of her work


175
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
inwardly. She was breathing in the Heavenly are and


176
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,300
gaining deeper fellowship with the resurrected Christ


177
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,900
one of her hymns expressed such a deep experience of the Lord and


178
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,100
in particular in his precious name.


179
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,200
Hers was not the ministry of power and


180
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,800
great outward achievement.


181
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,100
But rather of a life lived within the veil through the cross


182
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,400
in the heavenlies


183
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,900
once someone asked her,


184
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,100
what are the requirements to work for the Lord she replied?


185
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,000
The requirement to work for the Lord is not to work.


186
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,800
Some of the Chinese young people who received help from her were worried about her.


187
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,900
They wondered why doesn't she go out and establish meetings and work in a bigger city.


188
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,900
It seemed that it was a waste for her to live in a small village where nothing outwardly was happening,


189
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:33,200
but did not marry do the same when she poured out the precious ointment on her beloved Lord


190
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,300
the Lord charge that


191
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,700
such a net which fragrance filled the house


192
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,700
should be told of wherever the gospel is proclaimed.


193
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,100
and in the whole world


194
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,400
footnote one for Matthew chapter 26 verse 8 in the recovery version of the New Testament says


195
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,600
throughout the past twenty centuries thousands of precious lives


196
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,500
heart Treasures High positions and


197
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,300
golden Futures have been wasted upon the Lord Jesus


198
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,700
to those who love him in such a way.


199
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,300
He is altogether lovely and


200
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,800
worthy of their offering.


201
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,800
What they have poured upon Him is not a waste but


202
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,600
a fragrant testimony of his sweetness.


203
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,300
We're too weak sisters the thought of evangelizing the vast land of China seemed but


204
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,400
a distant dream,


205
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,100
but they soon realized that


206
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,800
God would raise up young people from among the Chinese population for his own sake


207
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:03,200
for this they were willing to bury themselves as seeds in the ministry of prayer for 10 long years.


208
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
God finally answered their prayers


209
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,200
during the tenth year of their seemingly fruitless Labour a Revival broke out in fuchao among those


210
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,500
Raised up at that time.


211
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,400
We're Leland Wang KH way


212
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,300
faithful Luke Wilson Wong and many other young brothers and sisters.


213
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,700
These would frequently go to Miss Barbara to receive training and spiritual instruction


214
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:33,500
to meet the many spiritual needs Miss Barbara prepared a group of houses around her residence


215
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,700
for the purpose of hospitality.


216
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,000
She would conduct training classes in some of these houses,


217
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,100
but it was the private fellowship and long


218
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,900
Channel talks that became the greatest edification in perfecting for one particular young Seeker named Watchman Nee


219
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,100
Whenever he had a problem or


220
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,800
needed spiritual instruction or


221
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,600
strengthening he would go to Emmy Barber.


222
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,700
She treated him as a young learner and


223
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,100
frequently administered strict discipline.


224
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,100
We had a co-worker's meeting every Friday


225
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,600
in which the other five were forced to listen to the arguing between the two of us


226
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,900
after having a dispute on Friday.


227
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,800
I would go to Sister Barber on Saturday and


228
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,300
accuse the other co-worker.


229
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,500
Whether that co-worker is wrong or


230
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,900
not is another matter


231
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,700
while you are accusing your brother before me.


232
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,500
Are you like one who is bearing the cross?


233
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,600
Are you like a lamb?


234
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,600
When she questioned me in this way,


235
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,000
I felt very ashamed and


236
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
I could never forget it


237
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,000
my speech and my attitude that day revealed that I was indeed not like one bearing the cross


238
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
not like the lamb.


239
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,200
Everything about Miss Barber or


240
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,100
a touch of the Lord's presence


241
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,900
Watchman Nee often told of a time when he went to visit her in her home.


242
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,900
Even while waiting for her in her living room.


243
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,800
He had a deep sense of the Lord's presence.


244
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,300
In one of her papers,


245
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,100
she had written.


246
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,700
I want nothing for myself.


247
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,800
I want everything for the Lord.


248
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:29,600
This was her prayer to the Lord later Watchman Nee adopted this impressive prayer as his motto.


249
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,200
Day by day Miss Barbara anticipated the Lord's return


250
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,800
on the last day of 1925 as she and


251
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,500
Watchman Nee were praying together.


252
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,700
She prayed


253
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,600
Lord. Will you really let the year 1925 pass away?


254
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
Although it is the last day of the year.


255
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,100
I still ask you Lord to come today.


256
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,400
Sometime later as the two of them walk together.


257
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
They neared a corner.


258
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,600
She said perhaps as we turn the corner we will meet him.


259
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,700
To her the Lord's return was not a Doctrine but


260
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,900
a Living Hope which governed her work and living.


261
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,700
Quietly in the remote Village of biotin


262
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,800
a different kind of missionary and


263
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,400
Pioneer was slowly charting the course of another field


264
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,600
the field of life and Resurrection in the Divine and mystical realm


265
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,900
the daily beautiful Vista of these little boats along the mid-river


266
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,600
would likely have given her the inspiration


267
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,100
to write about the even more beautiful and


268
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,600
Serene life of Faith,


269
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,200
which she now possessed.


270
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
a him like milk and honey


271
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,800
is the outflow of a life that


272
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,900
has learned lessons and


273
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,600
is dealt with


274
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,300
this cannot happen in one day and one night.


275
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,000
After living a hidden life and


276
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,700
that remote corner of the world for 20 years


277
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
at the end of February 1930.


278
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,100
She contracted enteritis


279
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,500
a disease of the intestines today commonly known as Crohn's disease.


280
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,100
Within a short time she concluded her 63 years of Earthly pilgrimage.


281
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,200
It is said that


282
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,500
before she departed.


283
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,400
She was shouting life life


284
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,200
in a package of personal belongings,


285
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,800
which was given to Watchman Nee upon her death


286
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,800
was a note which said


287
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,100
Dear Lord,


288
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,100
I thank you


289
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,100
because you have a commandment saying you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart


290
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,200
and with all your soul and


291
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,500
with all your mind.


292
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,700
She was buried in the village of by gotten


293
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,200
on her gravestone were engraved the words the resting place of Miss.


294
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,300
Emmy Barber


295
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,600
met a double portion of her spirit.


296
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
Be upon us.


297
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,700
Today visitors cannot readily find her grave site.


298
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,900
We were fortunate enough to meet Mr.


299
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,600
Wong who talked about her burial site.


300
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,400
She was buried back in the Hills up there


301
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,100
that is a place for foreigners apart for foreigners to be buried


302
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,200
there were two or


303
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,700
three dozen people buried there.


304
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,400
There were all foreigners from fuchao


305
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,400
some who lived in future were also buried there.


306
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,200
We called it the cemetery for Shantae the nickname for foreigners


307
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,300
Mr. Wong led us to her grave. We walked and


308
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,000
walked up the hill on an unpaved dirt road.


309
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,800
Finally we turned and


310
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,700
came to a grassy.


311
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,200
Deserted Knoll halfway up the lane.


312
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,900
This is the place where Miss Emmy Barber was buried.


313
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,400
They were not covered up originally.


314
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,900
They were people guarding the grapes


315
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,300
there was even wall at one time with custodians.


316
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,900
But after the Communists came the custodians were gone


317
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,200
by 1960. We're having a famine and


318
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
no one was fed. Well,


319
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,800
the graves were destroyed in the pot was converted into a potato field.


320
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,500
Here with a panoramic view of the land and


321
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,100
the country that she loved


322
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,800
and had sacrificed her entire life for


323
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,600
Emmy Barber was laid to rest.


324
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,100
It was a long journey from the little English Hamlet to The Faraway land of fuchao China.


325
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,400
She followed the footsteps of her master and


326
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,900
became a drink offering to satisfy the one she loved supremely


327
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,500
through such sacrifice.


328
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,600
She also became the channel through which the Lord raised up Watchman Nee


329
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,500
one great vessel in the 20th century


330
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,900
and through that ushered in the great move of God's economy in this present age.
