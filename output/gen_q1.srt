1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Although archaeology 11 dense point to China as one of the cradles of human race.


2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,200
There are no written records from before 3,000


3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,100
BC and the era immediately after


4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,500
hence this period is referred to as legendary


5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,300
It is believed that


6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,700
the yellow Emperor lived during this time


7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,700
and is considered the founder of ancient Chinese civilization.


8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,400
next game China's Bronze Age under the rule of the sea on Dynasty


9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,500
followed by the Shang Dynasty during which the Oracle bones were inscribed


10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,700
the dough Dynasty in the inh mock both feudalism and


11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,000
the age of sages


12
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,000
despite the rise of philosophically thought with thinkers like Confucius and loads of


13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,600
the futile struggle for power eventually led to the Warring States period


14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,400
Division empowering keep the Ching Sting the advantage to conquer all the other states


15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,100
and to subsequently become the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China


16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,200
the reign of King.


17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,200
However, did not survive very long after Ching sure ones death


18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,300
he gave way in 206 BC to the Western Han Dynasty


19
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,500
the short-lived Shang Dynasty.


20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,900
And then the Eastern Han Dynasty


21
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,700
the Han dynasties for century-long rule is


22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,500
You got it as the golden age in Chinese history


23
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:34,800
great advancements were made in areas ranging from economics and education to Science and Technology.


24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,600
However,


25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,600
an agrarian crisis and


26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,200
the following peasant rebellion led first to the loss of power of the Hun rulers


27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,400
and then to the romanticize era known as the Three Kingdoms.


28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,400
There was a decline in both population and


29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,200
economy as China witnessed the bloodiest point in its history.


30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,700
Only recovering a little after a brief reunification during the Jin Dynasty


31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,800
the North and South dynasties brought the appearance of the Chinese Pagoda alongside the spread of Buddhism


32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,200
while the sui Dynasty built the Grand Canal which Remains the longest in the world today.


33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,700
Art and literature Blossom during the Golden Age of the Tang Dynasty


34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,400
and continue to flourish after the five dynasties from the song to The Yuan Dynasty


35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,000
Mongolian rule collapse in 1368 and


36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,800
made way for the Ming Dynasty


37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,100
which saw the building of structures like the Imperial Palace


38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing


39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,200
the last Dynasty of Ching founded by a Manchurian Clan faced numerous rebellions lead.


40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,800
Do emperor puyi he's application? Dr.


41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
Sun Yat-sen,


42
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,300
then established a Republic of China


43
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,700
when civil war broke out the Communist Party give you that


44
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
the calming down


45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,900
and started its role under the flag of the People's Republic of China and


46
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,600
the leadership of mounted on


47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,900
the introduction of opium during the Qing Dynasty and


48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,300
the consequent Wars had left China in a vulnerable state


49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,300
this alongside political and civil.


50
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,100
rest resulted in waves of emigration from the 19th century to 1949


51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,600
A massive amount of bones with inscriptions have since been Unearthed providing insight to ancient Chinese writing.


52
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,300
Here are some examples of how Chinese words have evolved through pictures.


53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,200
The Chinese character for son derived from a circle and


54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,000
changed what it looks like now.


55
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,400
The word mountain is a simplified picture of three mountains that


56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,200
evolve into three Strokes.


57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,200
The word elephant began with a picture of an elephant which found its way to its present form.


58
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,000
The word rain


59
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,000
came from an image that


60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,200
looked like water drops falling from above


61
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,400
and overtime transform into how it is written today.


62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Understanding how words were formed in Chinese script give further insight into the ancestral roots of the people.


63
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,300
This is illustrated by setting it against the backdrop of the Bible


64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,200
an ancient book written by the Jews 3,000


65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,900
years ago.


66
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,500
The Jewish people lived in the Middle East with no external contact outside that


67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,000
region until the 17th century


68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
this meant that the Chinese and


69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,500
the Jews would have no knowledge of each other prior to that time


70
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,200
yet writings and records of both cultures point to a similar history.


71
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,100
First the question about the origin of man,


72
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,000
where did man come from


73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,000
chuang Tzu the tau is thinker rights in the beginning of all things.


74
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
There was a void


75
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
there was nothing that


76
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,600
could be named


77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,000
similarly the Bible starts with Moses writing the account of how in the beginning


78
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
the Earth was without form and void


79
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,000
Dong Dong shoe an out-of-town always think her rights.


80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,000
This origin is like the sauce its significance.


81
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,000
And it's permeation of Heaven and


82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,200
the Earth from the beginning to the end


83
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,400
parallel to this is the Jewish prophets John's writing about God as the origin and


84
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
a source of matter


85
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,200
and time.


86
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,300
I am the Alpha and the Omega I am the beginning and the end.


87
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,300
Starting from the writings of Moses and Genesis.


88
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,400
The history of mankind can be followed by setting Chinese characters


89
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,200
and the biblical account side by side.


90
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,700
The Bible reads


91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,800
and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground


92
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,700
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life


93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
and Man became a living being


94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,600
the Chinese word to create is formed by the word speak dust life and walk


95
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,000
as God spoke to the dust to dust receive the life and


96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,300
was able to walk


97
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,500
then he placed the first person Adam into the garden and blessed him.


98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,500
In Genesis,


99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,700
it says the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden


100
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,100
and there he put the man whom he had formed.


101
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,900
But Adam was lonely.


102
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,600
So God formed woman out of one of Adam's ribs and


103
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
called her Eve


104
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,500
in the garden.


105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,000
There were two special trees


106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,200
the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil


107
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,400
God forbade Adam and Eve to eat of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil


108
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
and warned of the death if they did.


109
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,800
I obeyed


110
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,400
we see this in the ancient Chinese word for restraint


111
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,000
which is made up of a mouth and a tree.


112
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,600
However, the devil disguised himself as a snake and tempted Eve.


113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,900
He persuaded her to think that


114
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,400
she would not die if she ate the fruit and


115
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,600
that her eyes would be open to see the things the way God did


116
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,700
knowing both good and evil


117
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,900
Eve then started to covet the trees fruit.


118
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,500
The Chinese word for covet desire or


119
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,100
greed is formed with two trees and a woman


120
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,500
when Eve ate the fruit and


121
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,400
gave it to Adam


122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,200
this brought death to them as written in the Bible.


123
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,600
They could no longer Live Forever In God's Presence


124
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,000
the word for put to death


125
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,700
comprises of his words,


126
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,900
which warned them that


127
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,800
if they partook of the Forbidden tree


128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,200
their life will return to dust from which they were taken.


129
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
According to the Bible


130
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,100
Adam and Eve were driven out of the garden of the day had sinned


131
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
and began to multiply the Earth


132
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,300
evil increased with Mankind and


133
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,700
God decided that they needed to be destroyed


134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,000
one man.


135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,800
However found favor in God's eyes and was spared


136
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,300
before God struck the Earth with a great flood.


137
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,800
He instructed Noah to build an ark


138
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,800
large enough to shelter a pair of each living creature as well as his family of eight himself.


139
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,200
His wife his three sons and


140
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,300
three daughters in law.


141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,900
The Chinese word for boat comprises of the word vessel with eight mouths in it symbolizing eight people


142
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:32,400
the word flood is made from the words eight United and Earth forming the word total and water


143
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,300
after the flood Noah set up an altar and


144
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,100
offered burnt offerings to God


145
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,900
for thousands of years during the New Year.


146
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,700
The Chinese have also set up.


147
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,400
An altar with burnt offerings to the god of Heaven this practice is still very much alive today.


148
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,400
Once the flood receded


149
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,800
people began populating the Earth and


150
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,300
after a period of time,


151
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,400
they gathered at The Plains of shinar


152
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,300
and began building a tower to reach the heavens


153
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
at that time.


154
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,300
Everyone. Spoke just one language.


155
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,600
The word tower in Chinese is made up of the words grass clay one mouth and Mankind


156
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,800
this agrees with the Bible when it says now the whole earth had one language and one speech


157
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
and it came to pass


158
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,500
as they journeyed from the East that


159
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,900
they found a plain in the land of shinar


160
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
and they dwelt there


161
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,700
then they say it to one another come that


162
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,700
is make bricks and


163
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,800
bake them thoroughly.


164
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,000
They had brick for stone and


165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,300
had asphalt for more top.


166
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,700
And they said come let us build ourselves a city and


167
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
a tower whose top is in the heavens


168
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,500
that is make a name for ourselves lest.


169
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,200
We be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.


170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,100
God was against what they were doing and


171
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,100
came down to confuse their language.


172
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,200
There was then a great division of languages


173
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,800
followed by the mass migration of mankind to different parts of the Earth


174
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,800
the Chinese character for my great consisting of the words great.


175
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:05,700
in


176
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,900
West and walk and capsule eights what happened and indicates where the Chinese went


177
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,000
from the great division in the west they walked


178
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
In the meantime


179
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,200
a man by the name of Abraham


180
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,600
living in the Middle East was called by God's leave his family in the place called Earth


181
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,900
God commanded Abraham to go to the land where he would show to him


182
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,700
and promised that he would be a great nation


183
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,200
Genesis chapter 12 verses 1 through 3.


184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Now, the Lord had said to Abram


185
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,900
get out of your country from your family and


186
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,000
from your father's house


187
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,100
to a land that


188
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,000
I will show you.


189
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,900
I will make you a great nation.


190
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,100
I will bless you and


191
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,800
make your name great and


192
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
you shall be a blessing.


193
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
I will bless those who bless you


194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and I will curse him who curses you


195
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,700
and in you all the families of the Earth shall be blessed.


196
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,100
It was a promise to Abraham that


197
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,000
through him and


198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,400
the generations after him.


199
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,100
He would bring the blessings of eternal life back to mankind.


200
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,300
The nation of Israel was a result of the ancient promised by God to One Man


201
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,800
42 Generations after Abraham.


202
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,400
Am Jesus was born.


203
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,400
Jesus was the son of God who was sent 2,000


204
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,300
years ago to bring Redemption to the whole world.


205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,300
Jesus lived for only 33 years,


206
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
but during the last three years of his life.


207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,500
He healed the sick gave sight to the blind cast out demons and


208
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,800
even raised the dead


209
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,500
Jesus taught his disciples of other kingdom of God and


210
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,100
about clouds live rightly.


211
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,200
He commanded them to teach and


212
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,700
tell the world about the good news of redemption.


213
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,700
He was eventually


214
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,600
made by the people for teaching the truth about God,


215
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,800
but on the third day after he died


216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
he rose from the dead as proof of his deity.


217
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
And as an act of redemption of our souls,


218
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,500
he then gave Specific Instructions to his disciples to spread this good news


219
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,000
that Jesus became the sacrificial lamb that was slain


220
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,300
and the offering of his innocent blood to God would pay for our sins.


221
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,100
The Chinese word for sacrificial animal is formed with the word ox and lamb


222
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,700
Mind with the word sword and I'm blemish


223
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,400
this reflects a sacrifice to God by the Chinese


224
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,000
as well.


225
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,400
As Jesus as the sacrificial lamb that


226
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
was sinless and unblemished.


227
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,200
The next word righteousness is even more intriguing


228
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,400
a lamb above the word me which is made up of hand and spear


229
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,500
speaks of how Jesus the righteousness of God who became the sacrificial lamb for us


230
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,000
was pierced for our transgressions.


231
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,600
Just as Sin was brought into the World by a fallen man.


232
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,700
Redemption was brought into the World by a righteous one.


233
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:58,900
And now that Redemption is being offered to all Chinese


234
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,100
through the acceptance of Jesus as the one who was sent by shundi


235
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,600
the god of Heaven


236
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,900
to reconcile us back to him.
