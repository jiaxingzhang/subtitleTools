1
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:40,700
The ancient Chinese pictograms for reveal and man and garden make up the character for God.


2
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,100
Thus we see God's purpose is to reveal himself to the man whom he formed and


3
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,600
placed in the garden


4
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:00,900
combining the pictograms for God and one and man and garden fawns the character for


5
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:09,400
Happiness or blessing God set up a special relationship with the man Adam to bring happiness and blessing


6
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,300
combining the pictograms for two trees and


7
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,100
command forms the character for the word forbidden


8
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,400
this provides a summary of the conditions of the edenic Covenant.


9
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,500
How extraordinary that the Chinese pictograms for two trees and


10
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,500
command should be used to compose the word forbidden.


11
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:39,400
There is no logic in this apart from the Bible narrative in Genesis.


12
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,500
The ancient Chinese pictograms for life of motion and secret or


13
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,700
private and garden


14
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,000
and man form the character for devil or Satan.


15
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,600
This is an appropriate description.


16
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,700
In of how Satan entered into the garden by stealth and subtlety.


17
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,700
The pictograms for cover and two trees and devil form the character for tempter


18
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,000
an accurate description of what Satan did in the garden by tempting Eve?


19
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,100
The pictograms for man and


20
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,900
fruit form a character naked having Patinkin.


21
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Of the two didn't fruit Adam and


22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
Eve realized their nakedness before God.


23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,100
The pictograms for ancient and


24
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,300
weeds form the character sorrow


25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,000
thorns and thistles would come up instead of productive fruit


26
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,100
man's Disobedience to God's command brought sorrow into the world.
