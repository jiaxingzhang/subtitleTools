1.100

00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,900
The same God may have actually been recognized by the Chinese before the Jews and


5.900
7.700
2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,700
other races in the West.


9
12.800
3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Confucius spoke of a supreme Creator in many of his writings


13.300
18.400
4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,400
the book of oldest States how vast is chandi the ruler of men Below


19.200
20.200
5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
in the analects.


20.500
22.600
6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,600
He ascribed not to his own goodness,


22.900
26.300
7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,300
but credited it to Heaven who produced The Virtue in him


28.300
30.700
8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,700
loud Sue in the Tao Te Ching


31.100
33.200
9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,200
wrote about an unknown God and


33.200
35.700
10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,700
referred to him as the town or the way.


36.600
38.700
11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,700
I do not know his name name.


38.900
41.500
12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,500
Mtow for lack of better word.


41.700
43.500
13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,500
I call him Almighty.


44.400
45.500
14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,500
I do not know whose son.


45.500
48.100
15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,100
He is he is before any King.


50.700
52.800
16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,800
In John Chapter 14 verse 6.


53.100
57.500
17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,500
Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life


58.400
59.400
18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
in all history.


59.700
62.600
19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,600
Jesus was the only person who claimed he was the way.


64.700
67.700
20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,700
Another remarkable saying my loud Sue is that


67.700
69.300
21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,300
the towel exist as one


69.900
74.200
22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,200
one exists as to to exist as three and


74.200
75.700
23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,700
the three created everything


76.700
78.700
24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
what was loud Sue trying to describe


80
83.500
25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,500
without the Bible the Chinese cannot interpret this fully.


85.200
88.600
26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,600
In first John chapter 5 verse seven it reads


89.600
90.700
27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,700
for they are three that


90.700
92
28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,000
bear witness in heaven


92.500
95.500
29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
the Father the word or Jesus and


95.500
97.100
30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,100
the Holy Spirit and


97.100
98.700
31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,700
these three are one.


101.100
106.500
32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,500
Where the wise men of China preparing to people to understand their God as the Trinity of Heaven


107.400
113.900
33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,900
the three-tiered altar of sacrifice at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing seems to suggest just that


114.900
118.400
34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,400
this pattern of three is repeated in a number of gates that


118.400
119.700
35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,700
stand around it alter


120.300
122.300
36
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
the temple surrounding tears and


122.300
123.900
37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,900
the Temple of Heaven itself.


125.600
130.700
38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,700
In this manner Shanti has been honored in the past by Empress of China


131.100
133.700
39
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,700
and still is being honored in many homes and


133.700
135.800
40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,800
businesses owned by the Chinese.


136.400
139.500
41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,500
This is why there can always be found tree cups and


139.500
141.100
42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,100
tree Joss sticks on the altars


141.500
144.300
43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,300
with burnt offerings every new year so that


144.300
147
44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,000
the god of Heaven may be worshipped and remember
