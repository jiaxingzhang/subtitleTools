1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:05,900
The same God may have actually been recognized by the Chinese before the Jews and


2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,700
other races in the West.


3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,800
Confucius spoke of a supreme Creator in many of his writings


4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,400
the book of oldest States how vast is chandi the ruler of men Below


5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
in the analects.


6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,600
He ascribed not to his own goodness,


7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,300
but credited it to Heaven who produced The Virtue in him


8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,700
loud Sue in the Tao Te Ching


9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,200
wrote about an unknown God and


10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,700
referred to him as the town or the way.


11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,700
I do not know his name name.


12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,500
Mtow for lack of better word.


13
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,500
I call him Almighty.


14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,500
I do not know whose son.


15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,100
He is he is before any King.


16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,800
In John Chapter 14 verse 6.


17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,500
Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life


18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
in all history.


19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,600
Jesus was the only person who claimed he was the way.


20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,700
Another remarkable saying my loud Sue is that


21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,300
the towel exist as one


22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,200
one exists as to to exist as three and


23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,700
the three created everything


24
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
what was loud Sue trying to describe


25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,500
without the Bible the Chinese cannot interpret this fully.


26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,600
In first John chapter 5 verse seven it reads


27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,700
for they are three that


28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,000
bear witness in heaven


29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,500
the Father the word or Jesus and


30
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,100
the Holy Spirit and


31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,700
these three are one.


32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,500
Where the wise men of China preparing to people to understand their God as the Trinity of Heaven


33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,900
the three-tiered altar of sacrifice at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing seems to suggest just that


34
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,400
this pattern of three is repeated in a number of gates that


35
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,700
stand around it alter


36
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
the temple surrounding tears and


37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,900
the Temple of Heaven itself.


38
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,700
In this manner Shanti has been honored in the past by Empress of China


39
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,700
and still is being honored in many homes and


40
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,800
businesses owned by the Chinese.


41
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,500
This is why there can always be found tree cups and


42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,100
tree Joss sticks on the altars


43
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,300
with burnt offerings every new year so that


44
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,000
the god of Heaven may be worshipped and remember
