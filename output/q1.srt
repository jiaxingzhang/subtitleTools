00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We are all well aware of the suffering and


00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
evil in the world.


00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Horrific suffering


00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
unspeakable evil


00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
how then can anyone believe in the existence of an all-loving all-powerful God


00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and if God does exist,


00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
why would anyone want to worship Him?


00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Epicurus framed The Logical problem of suffering and


00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
evil like this


00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
if God is willing to prevent evil but


00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
not able then he's not all-powerful


00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
if he is able to prevent evil but


00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
not willing he is not good.


00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But if he is both willing and able


00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
how can evil exists


00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:60,000
and if he is neither able nor willing then why call him God in other words. It's


00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Equally impossible for God and


00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
suffering to both exist,


00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
but we know full well that suffering exists.


00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Therefore. God does not.


00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is this a good argument? Let's look at it more closely


00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
are these two statements logically inconsistent know


00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
here is an example of two logical inconsistent statements David can't be both married and a bachelor


00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
but there is no explicit contradiction between these two statements.


00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So there must be hidden assumptions behind this argument that would bring out the alleged contradiction here. They are.


00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If God is all powerful he can create any world he wants and


00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
if God is all loving


00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
he prefers the world without suffering.


00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So if an all-powerful all-loving God exists,


00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
it follows that suffering does not exist


00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
since suffering obviously does exist The Atheist concludes that God must not exist,


00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
but are the atheists to Hidden assumptions necessarily true


00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
consider the first assumption.


00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Can God create


00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Eight any world he wants what if he wants a world populated by people who have free will


00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
it's logically impossible for God to force someone to freely choose to do good


00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
posting free choices is like making a square circle.


00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not logically possible.


00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not that God lacks the power to perform the task


00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
is that the supposed task itself is just nonsense,


00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
so it may not be feasible.


00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
To create a world populated by people who always freely choose to do what is morally good.


00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So the first assumption is not necessarily true therefore the argument fails. And what about the second assumption?


00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is it necessarily true that God would prefer a world without suffering.


00:02:60,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How could we possibly know this


00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
we all know of cases where we permit suffering in order to bring about a greater good


00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
if it's even possible that God.


00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Those suffering in order to achieve a greater good then we cannot say this assumption is necessarily true.


00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
For The Logical problem of suffering to succeed


00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The Atheist would have to show that it's logically impossible that Free Will exists


00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and that it's logically impossible that God has good reasons for permitting suffering


00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
this burden of proof is too heavy to bear.


00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's quite possible that God and


00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
suffering both exist.


00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is why philosophers even if he is philosophers have given up on The Logical problem of evil.


00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ville


00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
we can concede that the problem of evil does not after all


00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
show that the central doctrines of theism are logically inconsistent with one another


00:03:60,000 --> 00:04:07,000
some philosophers have contended that the existence of evil is logically inconsistent with the existence of a theistic God.


00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No one I think has succeeded in establishing such an extravagant claim


00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's no knowledge on almost all sides that The Logical argument is bankrupt.


00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But this is hardly the end of the discussion.


00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We still need to explore the probability version of the problem of evil.
