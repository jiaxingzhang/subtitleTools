1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
From the specimens that Darwin obtained in the Galapagos.


2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
He actually handed these things


3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and how do you explain this


4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and in his notes actually,


5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
he came up with this diagram here a tree and


6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
he actually said I think so.


7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He was talking about different species


8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and maybe maybe those species came from some common ancestor.


9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Actually when it comes to finches we actually would agree.


10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's creationists that different fish species came from a common ancestor, but a finch


11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 CH is what they would have to come from which


12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
see Darwin wasn't just thinking about species


13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Darwin had a much bigger picture in mind


14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
when you look at the Origin of Species


15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and and read that book you'll find he made this statement


16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
from such a low and intermediate form both animals and


17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
plants may have been developed.


18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And if we admit this we must likewise admit that


19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
all organic beans which have ever lived on this Earth


20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
may be descended from some one primordial form.


21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:60,000
So he had in mind what we


22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Today know as an evolutionary tree of life that


23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
all life has arisen from some primordial form.


24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now, when you consider the classification system


25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
kingdom phylum class order family genus species,


26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
we would say as creationists and


27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
we have many creation scientists have researched this


28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
and for lots of reasons,


29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I would say the kind in Genesis 1 really is


30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
more at the family level of classification


31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
for instance is one dog kind and


32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
you see based on the biblical account there in Genesis.


33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 This one creationists have drawn up.


34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What they believe is a creation Orchard.


35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In other words, they're saying


36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
look there's great variation in the genetics of dogs


37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and Fincher's and so on and so over time


38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
particularly after Noah's flood you'd expect


39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
if there were two dogs for instance you could end up with different species of dogs


40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
as because there's an incredible amount of variability in the genes of any creature and


41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so you'd expect these different species up here,


42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:60,000
but there's limits dogs will always be dogs finches will always be finches.


43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 For instance take dogs.


44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay in a scientific paper dated January 2014


45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
scientists working at the University of California stated this


46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
we provide several lines of evidence supporting a single origin for dogs and


47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
disfavoring alternative models in which


48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
dog lineages arise separately from geographically distinct wolf populations,


49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and they put this diagram in the paper.


50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
By the way. That diagram is very very similar to this diagram that creationists.


51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Pose based upon the creation account in Genesis.


52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
In other words, you have a common dog ancestor to gives rise to the different species of dogs.


53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And that's exactly what we're saying here.


54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The word Evolution has been hijacked using what I call a bait and switch.


55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let me explain to you the word evolution is being used in public school textbooks and


56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we often see it and documentaries and so on


57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
it's used for observable changes that


58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:60,000
we would agree with and then use for unobservable changes such as molecules to man.


59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 See students are taught today.


60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Look there's all these different animals plants,


61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
but they're all part of this great big tree of life


62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
that goes back to some primordial form


63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and look we see changes changes in Ventures changes in dogs and so on


64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
now, we don't deny the changes.


65
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You see that you see different species of finches different species of dogs,


66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but then they put it all together in this evolutionary tree,


67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
but that's what you don't observe.


68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You don't observe that that's belief there.


69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That's their historical science that I would say was wrong.
