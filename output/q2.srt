00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In part 1 We Looked at The Logical version of the problem of suffering and evil


00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
this argument attempt to show that since suffering and evil exist.


00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It is logically impossible for God to exist and


00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
we explained why even atheist philosophers admit that this argument fails


00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But wait,


00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
it may still be argued that while it's logically possible that God and suffering.


00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Both exist is far from likely


00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
there's just so much pointless suffering. It seems improbable that God could have good reasons for permitting it.


00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the probability version of the problem


00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
suffering provides empirical evidence that God's existence is not impossible. Just highly unlikely. Is this a good argument


00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Consider three points


00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
first, we are not in a position to say with any confidence


00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that God probably lacks reasons for allowing the suffering in the world.


00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The problem is that we're Limited in space and time and in intelligence and insight


00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
God on the other hand sees every detail of history from beginning to end


00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and orders it through people's free decisions and actions


00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
in order to achieve his purposes God.


00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Have to allow a great deal of suffering along the way


00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
suffering which appears pointless within our limited scope of understanding


00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
may be seen to have been justly permitted by God within his wider framework.


00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Sometimes what we experience makes no sense until


00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
we gain a wider perspective and


00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
see the big picture designed by the Creator.


00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Here's the second Point relative to the full scope of the evidence God's existence May.


00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well be probable you see probabilities are always relative to background information. For example,


00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
if we consider only how much this man ways we would say is highly improbable that he's a world-class athlete,


00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
but when we're willing to consider new information that he's a professional sumo wrestler and


00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
World Champion we quickly


00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Is our view in the same way when the atheist claims that God's existence is improbable.


00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We should ask improbable relative to what background information


00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
if we consider only the suffering in the world. Then God's existence may very well appear to be improbable.


00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But if we're willing to look at the full scope of background information


00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
to take into account the powerful Arguments for God's existence.


00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We may come to a very different conclusion.


00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The third point is Christianity and Tails doctrines that increase the probability of the coexistence of God and suffering


00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
consider four of these first. The chief purpose of life is not happiness people often assume that if


00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
God exists his role is to create a comfortable environment for his human pets.


00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They think the ultimate goal of Our Lives on Earth is happiness.


00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And therefore God is obligated to keep us happy.


00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
However, Christianity presents a radically different view


00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
that the purpose of life is to know God this alone brings true lasting fulfillment


00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
suffering can bring about a deeper more intimate knowledge of God,


00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
even the part of the one who is suffering or those


00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Found him


00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
the whole point of human history is that God


00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
having given us Freewill is drawing as many people as he can into his unending Kingdom


00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
suffering is one of the ways God can draw people freely to himself.


00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In fact countries that have endured the most hardship often show the highest growth rates for Christianity.


00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
God Whispers to us in our Pleasures speaks in our consciences but


00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
shouts in our pains


00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
it is his megaphone to Rouse a deaf world.


00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Second mankind is in a state of rebellion against God and


00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
his purpose terrible.


00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Human Evils are testimony to man's depravity a consequence of his alienation from God.


00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The Christian isn't surprised that moral evil in the world on the contrary. He expects it


00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
the third Doctrine states that God's purpose


00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is not restricted to this life but


00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
spills over beyond the grave into eternal life.


00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This world is just the beginning the entryway to an unimaginable never-ending life beyond death store


00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Paul who wrote much of the New Testament underwent afflictions hardships calamities beatings imprisonments hunger


00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
yet.


00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He wrote


00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
We do not lose heart


00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
for this slight momentary Affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of Glory beyond all comparison


00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because


00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Look not to the things that are seen But to the things that are unseen


00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
for the things that are seen are transient,


00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
but the things that are unseen


00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
are Eternal


00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Paul understood that life on Earth and


00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
whatever suffering it holds for each of us is temporary.


00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Our pain will not endure forever,


00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
but our lives with God will


00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Paul was not belittle in the plight of those who suffer horribly in this life indeed he was


00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,000
None of them,


00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
but he saw that those suffering


00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:60,000
will be overwhelmed Forever by the ocean of joy that God will give to those will freely receive it.


00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
And the fourth Doctrine is this the knowledge of God is an incomparable good


00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
knowing god is the ultimate fulfillment of human existence an infinite good.


00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thus the person who knows God no matter how much he has suffered can still say


00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
God is good to me.


00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So if Christianity is true,


00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
it's not at all improbable that suffering and


00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
evil should exist.


00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:43,000
In summary for all these reasons the probability version of the problem of evil is no more successful than the logical version as a purely intellectual problem.


00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Then the problem of evil does not disprove God's existence. But even if those intellectual arguments fail the emotional problem of suffering and


00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
evil remains very powerful if you have suffered deeply or


00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
if you've watched someone


00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Love go through intense pain.


00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You may be thinking


00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
so what if God exists,


00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
why would I want to respond to him or worshipping


00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I feel cold and


00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
empty. I want nothing to do with him.


00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're not alone.


00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
God knows your name. He knows who you are and


00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
what you're going through


00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
God promises to be with you through your suffering. He can give you the strength to endure.


00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Jesus Christ also suffered,


00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
although he was innocent.


00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He was tortured and


00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
sentenced to death


00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
his suffering had a purpose to provide you and


00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
me with a life-giving connection to God


00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
not only does God exist,


00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
but he loves you. He seeks after you


00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
he offers you hope.


00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
And in time you will make all things new he will wipe every tear from their eyes.


00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There will be no more death or Mourning or crying or pain


00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
for the old Order of Things has passed away.
