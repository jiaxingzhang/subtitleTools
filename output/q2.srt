1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
From the specimens that Darwin obtained in the Galapagos.


2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
He actually handed these things


3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and how do you explain this and


4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
in his notes actually, he came up with this diagram


5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
here a tree he was talking about different species


6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
and maybe maybe those species came from some common ancestor


7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Darwin had a much bigger picture in mind


8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
when you look at the Origin of Species and and


9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
read that book you'll find he made this statement from such low and


10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
intermediate form both animals and plants may have been


11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Galloped and if we admit this we must likewise admit that


12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
all organic beans which have ever lived on this Earth


13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
may be descended from some one primordial form.


14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So he had in mind what we today know as an evolutionary tree of life


15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
that all life has arisen from some primordial form.


16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now, when you consider the classification system


17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
kingdom phylum class order family genus species,


18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:60,000
we would say as creationists and we have many creation scientists have researched this and


19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Lots of reasons I would say the kind in Genesis 1


20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
really is more at the family level of classification for instance is one dog kind.


21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There's one cat kind even though you have different generate different species and


22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
you see based on the biblical account there in Genesis 1


23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
creationists have drawn up what they believe is a creation Orchard.


24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In other words, they're saying look there's great variation in the genetics of dogs and


25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Fincher's and so on and so over time


26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
particularly after Noah's flood you'd expect if there were two dogs.


27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 For instance, you could end up with different species of dogs as


28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
because there's an incredible amount of variability in the genes of any creature.


29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And so you'd expect these different species up here,


30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but there's limits dogs will always be dogs finches will always be Fincher's


31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
for instance take dogs. 


32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay in a scientific paper dated January 2014


33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
scientists working at the University of California stated this


34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:60,000
we provide several lines of evidence supporting a single origin.


35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 For dogs and disfavoring alternative models in which


36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
dog lineages arise separately from geographically distinct wolf populations and


37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
they put this diagram in the paper.


38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
By the way, that diagram is very very similar to this diagram that


39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
creationist proposed based upon the creation account in Genesis. 


40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In other words. You have a common dog ancestor to gives rise to


41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
the different species of dogs.


42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And that's exactly what we're saying here yet the dogs.


43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well that's never used as an example of evolution. But the finches


44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Are particularly in the public school textbooks


45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
students are taught are see the changes that are occurring here.


46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The word Evolution has been hijacked using what I call a bait and switch.


47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let me explain to you.


48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The word evolution is being used in public school textbooks and


49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
we often see it in documentaries and so on


50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
it's used for observable changes that we would agree with


51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and then use for unobservable changes such as molecules to man.


52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let me explain to you what's really going on


53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:60,000
because I was a science teacher in the public schools and ceased


54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Institute today look there's all these different animals plants,


55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but they're all part of this great big tree of life that


56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
goes back to some primordial form and


57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
look we see changes changes in Ventures changes in dogs and so on


58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
now, we don't deny the changes you see that


59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you see different species of finches different species of dogs,


60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but then they put it all together in this evolutionary tree,


61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but that's what you don't observe.


62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You don't observe that that's belief there.


63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's their historical science that I would say was wrong,


64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
but you know what you do observe you do observe.


65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Observe different species of dogs different species of finches,


66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but then there are limits and you don't see one kind changing into another.
