1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm a synthetic organic chemist


2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
origin of life is purely synthetic organic chemistry.


3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's no way around it.


4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm perfectly situated to be commenting on


5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
this to be critiquing the origin of Life research.


6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It is a biological it is before biology takes over.


7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is purely synthetic organic chemistry.


8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Some people argue that


9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
since there's been hundreds of millions of years of vailable


10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the probability that there's the chance that


11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
these things could happen in hundreds of millions of years,


12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but that's not true time actually can be an enemy


13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
when it comes to organic synthesis Prebiotic synthesis is before biology.


14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So one has to make chemicals


15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
many of the chemicals that need to be made for life.


16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Our kinetic products meaning that


17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
they're not the most thermodynamically stable form for example carbohydrates,


18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
which is the main class of compounds.


19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is the these are the the units that hook together DNA.


20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
These are the units that I have identifying aspects on cell structure.


21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
These are the units that the cell is going to need for.


22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The energy of Life carbohydrates are kinetic products


23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
meaning that if they should form they would decompose.


24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Decompose over time and relatively short amounts of time.


25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They decompose the very reactions that 


26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
make them unless somebody is there to pull them out to


27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
fish them out to stop the process and


28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
put them in a bottle under anaerobic conditions


29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
in a freezer and not just one.


30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There's many many different types you have to do this


31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
they end up going through a process of


32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
what's referred to as caramelization.


33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Meaning that they polymerize they polymerize the very real


34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 All reactions that were used to make them just continue


35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and you get poly Aldo's you get poly condensation reactions and


36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
they caramelize or they undergo with formaldehyde


37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
which is a presumed Prebiotic chemical.


38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They undergo rapid cannizzaro reactions.


39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So the aldehyde is oxidized to formic acid and


40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
this nice carbohydrate that you made has just been reduced.


41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So the so the aldehyde the from the carbohydrate is gone back to an alcohol.


42
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So there's competing reactions.


43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Shins so time does not solve the issue.


44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The other problem is if you had 400 million years


45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to get to a certain point in


46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
a synthesis of a particular class of compounds now,


47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you run out of material.


48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Anytime you do synthesis, you run out of material,


49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
even when you've optimized deals and


50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
you got to go back to the beginning.


51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well say it took you four hundred million years


52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
to get to a certain point on a synthesis.


53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, you have to go back and make more


54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
but how do you go back and make more


55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
because nature never kept a laboratory.


56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Notebook never doesn't doesn't know


57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
how to go back never kept the record.


58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So even if it could make more


59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
it doesn't know how to


60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
so it's got to start all over again


61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
some but it doesn't know how to start over again.


62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 When doesn't know why they start over again


63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
because it's doesn't know what it's going toward.
