00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What is your answer to the absence of free will


00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
if God created every fiber of our being every atom every impulse Duty not also creates in


00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
did he not also create Satan and his actions?


00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let me go first and


00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
then Vince will give you the substance of it.


00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'll take a stab at that.


00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If the question is to hold together every assumption that is in that


00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
what is the purpose of God doing that then? Of course,


00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm assuming you also are


00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
wanting God to remain in the Paradigm


00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and that he is the creator of the universe and your life and mine.


00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When you know that an infinite perfect,


00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
God has created you and me.


00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
There are only four possibilities of God and


00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
creation. Number one that God would create nothing


00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
nothing at all.


00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Number two where he would create a world where there was no such thing as good or evil,


00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,000
uh name or


00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
world number three where he would create a world where we


00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Only choose good


00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
or number four


00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
create this world where there's the possibility of Good and


00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Evil with the freedom given to us.


00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No creation


00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
a moral world


00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
where we would only choose good or


00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
create a world like this where he has given us the freedom to choose good


00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and evil,


00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
this is the only one of the four worlds in which Love Is Possible.


00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If love is the Supreme ethic


00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and love is the ethic towards rich on the longing towards which we all stryer.


00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is the only one of the four possibilities


00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
in which love is given to us as a legitimate possibility


00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that me give you


00:01:60,000 --> 00:02:01,000
the illustration from a child and


00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
then move into some philosophical extensions of that.


00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You know,


00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
when you are a parent


00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
you look at life very differently than before you raise your first child.


00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then when you are a grandparent you look at it even more differently


00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
than you did when you were a parent when you're a parent you are so preoccupied with the worries and the fears


00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and that your time is given over


00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to that stress dissonance


00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
when you've got grandkids the wonderful thing is somebody else does the worrying


00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and you can just hug and hold and Say Goodbye at the end of the day


00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and get your life back again and get your house back again.


00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I don't know why a country musician is not yet written a song about this.


00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Soon as they go you get your house back you get your toys back you get everything back.


00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But I watched my grandkids


00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
GK Chesterton said he learned more from observing children than he ever did from going studying philosophy


00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
my three and


00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
a half year old grandson Jude who is now 6,


00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
he's a guy with an amazing vocabulary.


00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know where he gets it from but


00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
he's got it.


00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's the guy who dangles us feet at the table and


00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
looks across the table and


00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
says to you papa


00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
what he six now Surah he was about five and


00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,000
he looked at me and


00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
he said Papa.


00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What is the meaning of sophomoric?


00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who's


00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
teaching this guy? Where is he getting all of this? Right?


00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So nice three now is a wee little tyke sweet little boy precious little guy


00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and his mother had lost her car keys,


00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
and she's looking all over the place and confounded.


00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She pauses her daughter Naomi stops her forehead and says,


00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I must be losing my mind.


00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Jude comes and


00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
stands in front of her and


00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
said Mommy whatever you do,


00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
please don't ever lose your heart because I'm in there.


00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Tell me.


00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Where does he come up with something like that


00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
the longing to look at his mother and


00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
say to her don't ever lose your heart.


00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm in there


00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
love is the craving of the human heart


00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
to belong in the sacredness of trust and a relationship


00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
and that is what you longed for. And I longed for


00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
God and giving us freedom gave us the greatest possible gift we could ever have with the Great.


00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Possible vulnerability


00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
at the same time


00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and once you know him


00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and follow him and love him and enjoy his love


00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you will realize that for the sake of love and


00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
for the sake of that relationship with you.


00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He gives gives you that freedom


00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and there are only two kinds of Destinies that you have


00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
you can bend your knee to God said serious Lewis


00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and say to him your will be done


00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
or you refuse to bend that knee.


00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Need to him and


00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
he says to you your will be done.


00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If you really watched wish to enjoy the freedom


00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
of what this gift is all about for creativity and all


00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
then this is the world that gives you the possibility


00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
of love and


00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
the beauty of the sacredness of a relationship the more you get to know him


00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
the less you ask the other question because you know in his wisdom he has an explanation that


00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
In time and in eternity


00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
will be ultimately revealed that me give you one illustration and


00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
turn it over to Vince.


00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You take your two year old to a doctor


00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
for an injection


00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and the doctor is about to jab that needle and the two-year-old start screaming and sits at the back of the car. And on the way back says


00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't understand my mother


00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
she brought me here


00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
for him to Jap this in my arm.


00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Not only that I saw her paying him for doing that to me.


00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And then comes a few years that go by and


00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
as a disease stalking the land


00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and that little one has grown up and said if my mother hadn't done that


00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I would be a victim for what exactly is blinking the country.


00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now


00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
time is a necessary component for understanding the big picture.


00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have no doubt. God gives us the big picture when we say


00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I know get it. That is my brief. Answer to thank you.


00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Well one way to understand this challenge is that God is all good and


00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
God only creates good things.


00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So how is it that putting good things together if that's all that God creates could wind up with sin and evil.


00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let me just quickly give you


00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
a more trivial example,


00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
but one that I find helpful


00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
in understanding this and


00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
then a more serious illustration from my life


00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
the example that I find helpful is going to a buffet anyone like going to a buffet


00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I really like going to a buffet but


00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I am not a good Buffet eater


00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
because I go to the buffet and


00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
everything individually looks great.


00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And I'm not able to process the fact that some of these things don't go well together.


00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And so I put all of them on my plate


00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and it doesn't go. Well then or


00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
for the rest of the night.


00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's how I think about this God only creates good things,


00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
right? He creates the power for me to move my arm.


00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He creates the power for me to have free will


00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
they're both good things. I can use my arm to help someone up.


00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But if I put those two things together in the wrong way,


00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
then it's not a good thing.


00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And the more serious illustration in my life that makes me reflect deeper on this


00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
is of someone who has a child.


00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can remember as a teenager. I wasn't very kind to him and


00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
he wasn't very kind to me


00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
and I use those powers that God gave me to push him down rather than to help him up.


00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And I remember taking every opportunity I could to put this guy down


00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and then I learned a number of years ago that he had taken his life.


00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And at one point the Bible says for the wages of sin is death and


00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I had read that verse hundreds of times and


00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
it never really hit me until then and


00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I had to start asking questions.


00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Like would he have taken his life had I been kind to him had I use those very same powers of the movement of my arm and of the free will not to push him down but


00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:44,000
to help him up and I didn't know the answer to those questions. Sometimes I think we're too quick to look up and blame.


00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
God for the evil in the world and


00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
we're too slow


00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
to look to ourselves and turn that question around and ask.


00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What is our part


00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
in that GK Chesterton was once asked to write into a newspaper with an answer to the question what's wrong with the world and


00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
he wrote a very short letter. He wrote dear sirs.


00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I am sincerely yours GK Chesterton.


00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And so sometimes I think we're too quick to look up and blame God


00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
ironically the same God who when he was hanging down.


00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Across


00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
looked at the ones who are producing evil in his life and


00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the instinctive words of his heart or father


00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
forgive them.
