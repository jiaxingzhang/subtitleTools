1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Evidence is a hugely important thing


2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we need to clear up a total misunderstanding.


3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And that is that say my Christian faith


4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
is not evidence based faith is believing where you know,


5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
there's no evidence.


6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That is utter nonsense.


7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Why do I believe it because


8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I believe there's powerful evidence.


9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If you ask the basic document of the Christian faith


10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
what it means by faith if will tell you directly and


11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
let me give you a quotation of the purpose of


12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the Gospel of John the Fourth gospel.


13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It says this many other signs Jesus did


14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
in the presence of his disciples


15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
which are not written in this book,


16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
but these are written that


17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 You might believe that Jesus is the Messiah


18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
the Son of God and that believing


19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you might have life in his name.


20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
In other words, John is saying these things that


21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I've collected and written down they are to


22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
form the basis of belief


23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that is there evidence.


24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now, of course you want to know at what level


25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
or evidence and we could go all night talking about that.


26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But the crucial thing to perceive is


27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
when Christianity was launched on the world.


28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 World it was launched On The World by people.


29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 From a very unexpected background a Jewish background


30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
who started to say that they had evidence of meeting Jesus Christ


31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
risen from the dead.


32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So my Christian faith is based on evidence.
