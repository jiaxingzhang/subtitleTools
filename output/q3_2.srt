1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We are here to talk about big questions.


2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Maybe the biggest question of all


3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
does God exist.


4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I won't give you a proof tonight.


5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
But I hope I will give you some things to think about


6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
things that have led me from being an atheist


7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
to becoming a Believer and


8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
a follower of Jesus.


9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Perhaps the most widespread fundamental assumption


10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in the intellectual West today is that


11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
there is no reality beyond what natural science discovers


12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and that there is no Authority or good higher than the


13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Freedom of the individual now


14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
both science and individual Freedom are good,


15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but followers of Jesus like me have a different view.


16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We believe that both the deepest reality and


17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
the highest moral meaning or good authority


18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
are to be found in loving relationship.


19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why is nature regular?


20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why does it follow regular laws that


21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
even like can we understand them


22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and we're so used to these ideas today that


23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
we don't realize that there weren't actually that obvious to most people through


24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Most time and the reason for that is if you just live.
