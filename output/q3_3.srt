1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And the one hand academic work and research contributes to Faith


2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
but on the other I think my Christian beliefs


3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
provide an overarching framework of understanding


4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
of trying to discern how Knowledge


5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
from different disciplines fit together.


6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And what does it all mean?


7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And I started reading the Bible and


8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to my not wanting to tell anybody what was happening in me.


9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I started to change it started to change me and


10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought it would be sort of full of Fantastical crazy stuff.


11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
They actually had me start with Proverbs


12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
which was smart because it was full of so much wisdom that


13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'd read a few verses and I have to put it down


14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and Ponder what was going on here and


15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
it immediately hit me with


16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 my you know,


17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
my sort of intellectual arrogance


18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
that I had a lot to learn from what was written here.


19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 After a period of consideration,


20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I did reach the point of realizing that


21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I kind of did believe this that Christianity made sense to me


22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
made intellectual sense to me and that I needed to


23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
if I were to be true to what I thought was reality


24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and what I now think is reality that


25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I needed to take a step of commitment


26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and faith and and become a follower of Jesus


27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
and that and that's I did that and


28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I was baptized as on my 20th.


29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 birthday actually in the chapel of King's College, Cambridge


30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 And I'm studying issues of culture and race in my work


31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
and you know, not quite audibly


32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
but audibly and understandably God just kind of said


33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
hey, you know, I'm bigger than your African-American Miss.


34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm bigger than your racial background.


35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In fact, I created racial and ethnic identity


36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and different cultures.


37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I created at your study at let me show it to you.
