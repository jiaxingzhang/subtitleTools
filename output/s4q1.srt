00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Isn't Christianity at its core the same as other religions,


00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
if you could put it in a pot and


00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
boil it down wouldn't the remainder smell look and


00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
taste the same as Judaism Islam Buddhism


00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hinduism. And the rest


00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
what is religion


00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
just as we refer to our minds is being thoughts and


00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
ideas beyond the electrical impulses of our physical brain,


00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
the major religions proposed that


00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the humans true Essence is their soul instead of their physical body,


00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
but just like our physical bodies the soul also


00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
so has needs or


00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
it will starve


00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
each religion proposes to be a guidebook of that spiritual plane that helps lead are starving souls to sole bread


00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
aren't these guidebooks all the same


00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the historical Jesus of Nazareth told a story about a father two sons and


00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
a family business.


00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It was custom that


00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
the sons would split the business when their father died,


00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but the younger son said to his father.


00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I can't wait for you to die.


00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Give me my money now


00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:60,000
seeing his sons True Heart the father gave it up to him the sun turned his back.


00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
His family and hit the road


00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,000
far away.


00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He party like an animal eating and drinking and paying prostitutes until suddenly his pockets were empty


00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
in desperation.


00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He found a job feeding pigs,


00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but the country's economy crashed and


00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
he couldn't even make enough to feed himself


00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
now broke and starving.


00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He found himself craving the pig slop


00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
when it suddenly hit him that


00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
there was probably food back home.


00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What do you think should this father let him back into the house


00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
as long as the sun works hard to pay his father back.


00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Then he should be able to get a place for the family table again.


00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Right?


00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's see how Jesus ended the story


00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The Son decided to return admit his wrong and


00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
asked his father for a minimum wage job,


00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
but still a ways from home


00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
his father spotted him and


00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
ran out to him and


00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
wrapped him in a bear hug


00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
remorseful the sun began his plea dad.


00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You shouldn't even call me your son anymore,


00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,000
but the


00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Put a fine robe on him and


00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
a ring with a family crest.


00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He told his workers


00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
get the best meat and


00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
prepare a welcome home Feast for this son of mine was dead


00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and has come to life again.


00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He was lost and


00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
has been found.


00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Although Jesus told this as a story


00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
he was actually presenting his view of the truth in the story The Father represents God


00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
so is Jesus seriously teaching that


00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
God forgives selfish gluttons before they repaid their wrongs against him and others


00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Judaism teaches that one can atone for their wrongs by changing their behavior praying and


00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
doing good deeds


00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Islam says we can move towards Paradise by performing The Five Pillars.


00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hinduism claims that if we store up enough Good Karma will reunite with Brahman


00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Buddhism says we can Enlighten and


00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
discipline ourselves into Nirvana by practicing the Eightfold Path.


00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But in this story The Father embraced his son and


00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
fed him before he did any work why


00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
because in Jesus is view.


00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's impossible for a person to repay God for their bad Deeds.


00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
God is a perfect judge who cannot be bought off with anything that


00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
we have to offer.


00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Jesus said that when we die


00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We will face God with all of our Deeds laid out.


00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
None of us is completely morally perfect and


00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
none of us will stand a chance of justifying ourselves.


00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Then is there hope for us Jesus believe so and


00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
staked his life on it.


00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He claimed to be God in human form who came to pay our moral debt with his innocent life


00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
so that if anyone truly believed and


00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
surrendered to him,


00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
they would receive a full pardon from God and


00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
the power to change how they live


00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
other religions teach that


00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
our own self sacrifice can pay our


00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Our debt but Jesus taught that


00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
only God's own self sacrifice can pay our debt.


00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
All other religious Founders claim to be guides to lead are starving souls to bread.


00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Jesus claimed to be the bread our soul star for
