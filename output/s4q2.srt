00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In ad 203 the Roman government arrested a 22 year old woman a Christian named perpetua.


00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The problem wasn't so much that


00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
she worshipped Jesus her crime was that


00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
she worshipped only Jesus


00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
she refused to worship any other gods.


00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
As a result,


00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
she was found guilty of treason and


00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
sentenced to death


00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
this dangerous idea that


00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Christ Alone provides.


00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The way to God


00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
is called Christian particularism and


00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
it is a scandalous today as it was 2000 years ago


00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
religious pluralism on the other hand


00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
is the view that


00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
all the world's religions are equally valid and


00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Christ is just one of many ways.


00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Some religious pluralist say all the world's religions teach basically the same thing so they are all true.


00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But this is clearly mistaken


00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the major religions often contradict each other.


00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
For example,


00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
compare Islam and Buddhism


00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Muslims believe there is a personal God who created the world


00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
man is sinful and


00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
will spend eternity in heaven or hell


00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and salvation is attained by faith and


00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Performing good work.


00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
X


00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
but Buddhist deny all of this.


00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
They believe that Ultimate Reality is not a person the world was not created man is not sinful


00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
man is not an enduring self.


00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And the goal of life is not salvation.


00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's anihilation


00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
because these two worldviews contradict each other.


00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They can't both be true.


00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In fact,


00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
every major world religion contradicts every other one so they can't possibly all be true.


00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So other religious pluralist swill say


00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
all the world's religions are false.


00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They're equally valid but


00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
equally false cultural expressions of Mankind's search for truth.


00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But why I think that


00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
this is true why couldn't one particular religion be true


00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
when you examine the arguments for religious pluralism,


00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you find that some of them are textbook examples of logical fallacies, for example,


00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
anyone who believes that Christianity is


00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is true and every other view is wrong is arrogant therefore Christianity is false.


00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is a logical fallacy called argument ad hominem


00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
trying to show someone's view is false by attacking his personal character.


00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is a logical fallacy because


00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
the truth of a view


00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
is independent of the character of the person who holds it


00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
for example,


00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
if an arrogant person discovered the cure for cancer the fact that he's egotistical.


00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Would not mean his claim was false


00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and you wouldn't refuse treatment just because


00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
he was conceited


00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,000
moreover.


00:02:60,000 --> 00:03:04,000
This objection is a double-edged sword for the pluralist also believes that


00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
his view is true


00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and that everyone else is wrong.


00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Therefore


00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
if you're arrogant for holding to a view which many others disagree with


00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
then the pluralist himself would be guilty of arrogance.


00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Here is another pluralist argument religions are


00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Culturally relative


00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
if you had been born in Pakistan,


00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you'd likely be a Muslim.


00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But if you've been born in Ireland,


00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
you'd probably be a Catholic


00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
because religious beliefs are culturally relative.


00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They are not objectively true.


00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is an example of the genetic fallacy


00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
trying to invalidate a view by showing how a person came to hold the view.


00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This is a fallacy because


00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
the truth of a view is independent of how a person came to believe it


00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,000
for example,


00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If you had been born in ancient Greece you would have believed that


00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
the Sun goes around the earth.


00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Does that make your current belief that the earth goes around the Sun false or unjustified know


00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
furthermore.


00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This objection is also a double-edged sword


00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
for if the religious pluralist had been born in Pakistan or Island.


00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He'd likely have been a religious particular has


00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
so he's belief in religious pluralism is just the result of his being born in contemporary ways.


00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Stand society and therefore is not objectively true.
