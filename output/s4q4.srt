00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Appreciate that question and


00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,000
it's a question that


00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
has the assumption that


00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is very correct


00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
often times.


00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The Christian takes the hit


00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that he or she was a follower of Jesus Christ is the only one who lays claim to exclusivity that


00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
is not true.


00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Got them a Buddha was born a Hindu


00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and here announced two of the fundamental doctrines of Hinduism


00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
the authority of The Vedas


00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the caste system.


00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He could not accept those two


00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
went on his own journey in search of Enlightenment and


00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
came off course with the


00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Four noble truths and


00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
the Eightfold Path


00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and the ultimate extinguishing of desire


00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
in this nirvanic Pursuit.


00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So he turned his


00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
belief away from the religion of his birth in order to find a different answer


00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Islam is also exclusive aesthetic in its claim


00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
in all of its precepts and it's five pillars and so on.


00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What about these contradistinction 's


00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The first thing we need to know is


00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
there are distinctions.


00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There are fundamental differences at best.


00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There are superficial similarities.


00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I often hear the question posed wrongly


00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
they'll say are all really aren't all religions fundamentally the same and


00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
superficially different know


00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
they are fundamentally different and


00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
at best they are superficially similar.


00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What are the fundamental claims for example in Buddhism.


00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The goal is to escape extinguish.


00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
GE extinguish desire.


00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I remember talking to the first woman monk


00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
who is from Thailand to be ordained into the Buddhist.


00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Priest Hood,


00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
but Thai Buddhist do not ordain


00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
women. So she went to Sri Lanka


00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
to be ordained and


00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
she has a PHD in Philosophy from McMaster University in Hamilton,


00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ontario and


00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Waterloo, I guess Ontario and


00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
McMaster devere University there


00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
got her PhD in philosophy and


00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
she gave me the first


00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
View we chatted for well over an hour one on one


00:01:60,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and I sort of angled into some questions because


00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I didn't want to be too discourteous.


00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And one of the things I said to her is I hear you're married and


00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
she said yes


00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I said you have children.


00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
She said yes


00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I said but you're living in a temple by yourself.


00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She said yes.


00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I said you not see your children.


00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
She started crying.


00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She said I have a car


00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I said you have a car she said yeah,


00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
she said okay,


00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
so she


00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
drove herself because she can't allow a man to drive her.


00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
She said so she has to drive herself


00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
and she says every evening at the end of the day.


00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I try and meet up with one of my children.


00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She said this is the hardest part of my life


00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I said so you are on the journey to extinguishing the desire to be with your children.


00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Is that right? Is that a fair assessment?


00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
She kept quiet.


00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And then I said this I said the Dalai Lama


00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
has as as primary Pursuit now


00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
the freedom of Tibet she said that's right.


00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I said,


00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
why does he desire that?


00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
She looked at me and


00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
she said we try not to get into these philosophical questions.


00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's just say that


00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
he chooses to


00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you take a look at other world religions


00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and see where these four questions are dealt with origin meaning morality and Destiny.


00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
These four questions have to be answered in two ways.


00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Follow me, please


00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
every particular answer has to correspond to truth


00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
either through empirical form of measurement or


00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
through the logical reasoning process


00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and windows for answers are put together.


00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They must go here.


00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And not be incoherent so the to test correspondence and coherence.


00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I guarantee you only in the judeo-christian worldview.


00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Will you find these four questions answered with corresponding truthfulness


00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and with the coherence of a world view? Let me take just one example,


00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
and I don't say this to slight but


00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
this is a fact and


00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
we have to deal with it.


00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I've been invited in many many Islamic countries and


00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I have open forums there and


00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
going to go to one of the toughest Islamic countries with the next few weeks.


00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
They've hosted me in many parts there and


00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
we've had dialogues.


00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I want to give to you two things.


00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
in the Quran


00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
it is the only historical Lee claimed document


00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
that denies that Jesus Christ was actually crucified or


00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
died on the cross denies that


00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the Greek historians say he died on the cross Roman historians.


00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Say that


00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Pagan historians say that Jewish historians say that and


00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Christian historians say that


00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,000
the Islamic


00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the the Quran is the only one that says it appeared to him that he died,


00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but he didn't actually die on the cross.


00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So historically it is making a formation


00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
that is really historically untrue.


00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I got into a discussion with Sheikh Hussein of the leading.


00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Shiite cleric in Damascus Syria as a real gentleman


00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
for over three hours.


00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We talked with an interpreter between us


00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and an audience listening and


00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was allowed to ask him one question about his faith and


00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
he was allowed to ask me one question.


00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But mine


00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
there was nothing no Rancor no adversarial stance just a perspective encounter perspective and back and forth


00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's the best way to do it really


00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
at the end of it Sheikh husam looked at me was very respectful to the whole time always refer to me as professor.


00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Zachary has Professor Zacharias


00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and then at the end he looked at me leaned over and he said,


00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
you know professor.


00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think the time has come


00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
for us in the Islamic world to stop asking if Jesus Christ died and


00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to start asking why.


00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I said to him.


00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
May I quote you on that sir?


00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He said yes,


00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
you may I'm am hopefully going to go there before long and


00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I hope we can meet up again


00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
origin meaning morality and Destiny


00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the judeo Christian worldview is not the only one that claims exclusivity


00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
but is the only one that takes those four questions with corresponding answers that are truthful


00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and coherent answers that


00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
stand the test of time


00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and the ultimate answer of the Resurrection from the dead


00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
that gives you hope and


00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
meaning I see we have one more


00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
more question left and


00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
that's the sign here.


00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll be happy to take that.
