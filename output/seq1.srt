1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Evolution you learned about it in high school.


2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It goes like this life started out


3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with very simple forms and then


4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
gradually over hundreds of millions of years


5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
morphed into all the forms.


6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We see today bacteria to Beethoven not a straight line,


7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
of course, but that's roughly how it went.


8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This was the theory proposed by Charles Darwin in 1859


9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and with some modification.


10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's been embraced as unassailable


11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
by the scientific community over the last century.


12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
As evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins says


13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
if you meet somebody


14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
who claims not to believe in evolution


15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that person is either ignorant stupid or insane.


16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But is that right


17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
are there no, scientific reasons to doubt


18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The evolutionary count of life's origins in November 2016.


19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I attended a conference in London convened


20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
by some of the world's leading evolutionary biologists


21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the purpose to address growing doubts about


22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
the modern version of Darwin's theory.


23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's look at just two scientific reasons to doubt this Theory


24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
first the Cambrian explosion a weird


25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and wonderful thing happened 530 million years ago a whole


26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
each of major groups of animals


27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
what scientists call the phyla


28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
appeared abruptly within a geologically short window of time


29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
about 10 million years


30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
these novel animal forms exhibiting


31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
prototypes of most animal body designs.


32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
We see today emerged in the fossil record


33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
without evidence of earlier ancestors.


34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Did you catch that


35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
a huge number of diverse animals


36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
appeared with no discernible antecedents?


37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So where do they come from


38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
this question really bothered Darwin


39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
and he acknowledged that


40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
he could give it no satisfactory answer


41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
nor can scientists today.


42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The renowned biologist Eugene. Koonin


43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
of the national Center for biotechnology information


44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
describes the abrupt appearance of the Cambrian animals


45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and other organisms such as dinosaurs birds flowering plants and mammals


46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
as a pattern of biological Big Bangs.


47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So what caused all these new forms of life to arise


48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That question leads to a second big doubt


49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the DNA Enigma in the 1950s James Watson and Francis Crick


50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
made a startling Discovery the DNA molecule stores information


51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
as a four-character digital code strings


52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
of precisely sequence chemicals


53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
inside the DNA Helix store,


54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the instructions the information for building the crucial proteins


55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
that cells need to survive


56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
unless the chemical letters in the DNA texts are sequenced properly.


57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
A protein molecule will not form no proteins.


58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No cells. No cells. No living organisms.


59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Bill Gates has said DNA is like a software program.


60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's think about that for a second


61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
for computers to run faster and perform more functions.


62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
They require new code.


63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, the same is true for life to build new forms of life.


64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The evolutionary process would need to


65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
produce new genetic information new code.


66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But this raises questions about the creative power


67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
of natural selection of mutation


68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
natural selection is a simple sorting process


69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
species keep favorable mutations that allow them to survive.


70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've but eliminate bad mutations that cause their members to die out.


71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No one doubts that natural selection is a real process


72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and that it produces minor variations,


73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
but many biologists now doubt that it produces major Innovations in biological form


74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
to see why I think again about software


75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
what happens if you introduce a few random changes into computer code,


76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
you'll likely mess it up right though.


77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It might still work if you don't make too many changes,


78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
but if you make


79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
enough random changes your program


80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
will stop functioning all together.


81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You certainly can't keep doing this and expect some cool new program to pop out.


82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There's a mathematical reason for this in all codes and languages.


83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There are vastly more ways of arranging characters that will generate gibberish.


84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then there are Arrangements that will generate meaningful sequences


85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and this applies to DNA remember natural selection


86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
only selects sequences that random mutations generate.


87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yet experiments have established that


88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
DNA sequences capable of making stable proteins are extremely rare


89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and thus really hard to stumble on randomly.


90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,000
How rare


91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
while working at Cambridge University molecular biologist Douglas acts show that


92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
for every DNA sequence that generates a relatively short functional protein.


93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There are 10 to the 77th power non functional sequences.


94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now consider that there are only 10 to the 65th power atoms in our galaxy.


95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So finding a new DNA sequence capable of building a functional protein


96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
is like searching blindfolded for a single marked Adam among a trillion Milky Way galaxies


97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
talk about a needle in a haystack


98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
as I show in my book Darwin's doubt,


99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
even four billion years of life's history is not enough time


100
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
to overcome a search problem this big


101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
so to Serious doubts about modern darwinian.


102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The Cambrian explosion the sudden appearance of new animals


103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
which evolutionary theory has failed to explain


104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and the DNA Enigma the impossibility of random mutations


105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
producing the information needed to build new forms of animal life


106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
scientists who know about these problems are not ignorant stupid or insane.


107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
They are just appropriately skeptical.


108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm Steven Mayer senior fellow at The Discovery Institute for Prager University.
