00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I got my PhD in


00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
the field of organic chemistry postdoc at Stanford University joined the group of a man


00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
who is going to win a Nobel Prize in chemistry


00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
voted one of the top 50 most influential Minds in the world.


00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I was a visiting scholar at Harvard University.


00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've spoken it


00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
every major university in this country have over 650 research Publications voted the


00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Rd magazine scientist of the year.


00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm in the National


00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
enemy of inventors.


00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a member of the American Association for the advancement of science over a hundred and


00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
twenty patents started


00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
seven or eight companies.


00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We work in areas that


00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
range from medicine


00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
to Material Science to electronics computer memory medical devices.


00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We work across a broad range of areas,


00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
but more than any effect.


00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What means the most to me is that


00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm a Jew who believes that


00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Jesus is the Messiah


00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I grew up just outside of New York City.


00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I thought everybody was Jewish.


00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I didn't even know that there was


00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
anything else I had no particular interest in that


00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
other than when all my friends were getting bar mitzvahed or


00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
bat mitzvah and


00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
then I would attend of course every week there was never really any excitement for me.


00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Remember once I even tried to talk to a rabbi.


00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He just brushed me off.


00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It was very little explanation for me.


00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I remember


00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
when I went to college


00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I started meeting


00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
a number of people that said that they were born again Christians,


00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
which was sort of an odd term.


00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was


00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
what born again.


00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What do you mean born again?


00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
One person saw me in the laundry room if he said


00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
do you mind if I give you an illustration


00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,000
of the gospel?


00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And I remember we sat there and


00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
he actually started to draw a picture a cliff with a


00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
With a man on one side and


00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
he drew a little man and


00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
then another Cliff with God on the other side


00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and a big chasm in between that he labeled.


00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's in and looked at him I said,


00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm not a sinner.


00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I've never killed anyone.


00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I never robbed the bank.


00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How could I be a sinner


00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
and he had me read a verse from the Bible


00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
for all have sinned and


00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
fall short of the glory of God


00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
in modern Judaism.


00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We never really talked about Sin.


00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't remember ever talking about


00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,000
In in my home,


00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so he turned to another passage.


00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Jesus said I say to you that


00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
everyone who looks upon a woman


00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
with Lust For Her


00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
has already committed adultery with her in his heart.


00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Pop I felt


00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
just


00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
as if I'd been punched right in the chest pure.


00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I was new in college.


00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I didn't think anybody knew


00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I would pick up these magazines and


00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I became addicted to pornography


00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
who's just through those magazines


00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and all of a sudden


00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
something that's


00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
written in the Bible.


00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Somebody from lived who lived 2000 years ago is calling me out on it.


00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And I felt immediately convicted and


00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
that now I realized I was a sinner.


00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When I read


00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
in the scriptures,


00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
what sin is


00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
then? I knew I was a sinner.


00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
How am I going to get to God?


00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We Jews know this better than anyone else without the shedding of blood.


00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There is no forgiveness of sin


00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
this description in Isaiah 53 of how he will bear


00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
upon himself mice in


00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the things that I had done.


00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And this was him.


00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This was the man


00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Took this upon himself on the cross.


00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The perfect God comes and


00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:60,000
gives himself for us.


00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He is the one


00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
that gives himself for us


00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
started to realize


00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
how Jewish


00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
the New Testament is.


00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This book is so Jewish.


00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The New Testament is so Jewish.


00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's all around Jewish people


00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and then


00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
on November 7 1977.


00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I was all alone in my room the realization.


00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That Yeshua


00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
is the one who died on the cross and


00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I said Lord,


00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I am a sinner.


00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Please forgive me come into my life


00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and then all of a sudden someone was in my room.


00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And I opened my eyes.


00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I was on my knees.


00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I opened my eyes.


00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I was in my room that man


00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Jesus Christ stood in my room.


00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This amazing sense of God.


00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Jesus was in my room and


00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I wasn't scared.


00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
All I started doing was just weeping.


00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The presence was So Glorious because


00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
he was there in my room on that day.


00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And I didn't want to get up and


00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
this amazing sense of forgiveness just started to come upon me.


00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
There was a


00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,000
family I got up.


00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I didn't know what to do.


00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I didn't know who to tell yours is Jewish kid from New York City,


00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
but I'm going to say


00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
my cousins were shocked.


00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
How could you do that? You're Jewish telling


00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
my mother how I had invited Jesus into my life.


00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She didn't say much.


00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,000
She was weeping.


00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
She told my father they weren't happy at all.


00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And she said I don't blame them for Killing Jesus after the things that he said,


00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
who is he to come against these religious leaders?


00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That have dedicated their lives to helping people


00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and to tell them that


00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
there are whitewashed tombs.


00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who is he this young man in his 30s to say this to these Scholars?


00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He got what he deserved and


00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
my mother's a very deep pensive careful reader.


00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She read from Genesis right on through the Tanakh the whole thing when she got done.


00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I said,


00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
what did you think? She said God warned us over and over again?


00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He warned us when my daughter was about 15 my mother and


00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
father came to visit us.


00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,000
At one point,


00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
my mother went into her room for several hours.


00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
She came out.


00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
She said the quite a young girl you have she talked to me for a long time.


00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She started reading the Bible again both the Old and


00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
the New Testament


00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
one day not long after that.


00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
She called me on the phone at the age of 72.


00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She said Jimmy you wouldn't believe what happened.


00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is what happened.


00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
She said I was just reading and


00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
it hit me.


00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It hit me the way he gave his life.


00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I believe it now Jesus is the son of God.
